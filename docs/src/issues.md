## libnetcdf not properly installed

If you see the following error,

```
ERROR: LoadError: LoadError: libnetcdf not properly installed. Please run Pkg.build("NCDatasets")
```

you can try to install netcdf explicitly with Conda:

```julia
using Conda
Conda.add("libnetcdf")
```

## NetCDF: Not a valid data type or `_FillValue` type mismatch

Trying to define the `_FillValue`, procudes the following error:

```
ERROR: LoadError: NCDatasets.NetCDFError(-45, "NetCDF: Not a valid data type or _FillValue type mismatch")
```

The error could be generated by a code like this:

```julia
using NCDatasets
# ...
tempvar = defVar(ds,"temp",Float32,("lonc","latc","time"))
tempvar.attrib["_FillValue"] = -9999.
```

In fact, `_FillValue` must have the same data type as the corresponding variable. In the case above, `tempvar` is a 32-bit float and the number `-9999.` is a 64-bit float (aka double, which is the default floating point type in Julia). It is sufficient to convert the value `-9999.` to a 32-bit float:

```julia
tempvar.attrib["_FillValue"] = Float32(-9999.) # or
tempvar.attrib["_FillValue"] = -9999.f0
```


## Corner cases


* An attribute representing a vector with a single value (e.g. `[1]`) will be read back as a scalar (`1`) (same behavior in python netCDF4 1.3.1).

* NetCDF and Julia distinguishes between a vector of chars and a string, but both are returned as string for ease of use, in particular an attribute representing a vector of chars `['u','n','i','t','s']` will be read back as the string `"units"`.

* An attribute representing a vector of chars `['u','n','i','t','s','\0']` will also be read back as the string `"units"` (issue #12).

* While reading a NetCDF time variable, the dates are converted using the Julia's `DateTime` (based on the proleptic Gregorian calendar following the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard) when possible. When data is written to a NetCDF file (without specifying the calendar), the dates are saved using the default calendar of the NetCDF CF convention (the mixed Julian/Gregorian calendar, called `"standard"`) when possible. It is recommended that the time origin specified by the units is after 15 October 1582 in which case the mixed Julian/Gregorian calendar is identical to the proleptic Gregorian calendar.
