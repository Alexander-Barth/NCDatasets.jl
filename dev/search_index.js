Likewise setting diskless or persist to true will enable the flags NC_DISKLESS or NC_PERSIST flag. More information is available in the NetCDF C-API.\n\nNotice that this does not close the dataset, use close on the result (or see below the do-block).\n\nThe optional parameter attrib is an iterable of attribute name and attribute value pairs, for example a Dict, DataStructures.OrderedDict or simply a vector of pairs (see example below).\n\nSupported format values:\n\n:netcdf4 (default): HDF5-based NetCDF format.\n:netcdf4_classic: Only netCDF 3 compatible API features will be used.\n:netcdf3_classic: classic netCDF format supporting only files smaller than 2GB.\n:netcdf3_64bit_offset: improved netCDF format supporting files larger than 2GB.\n:netcdf5_64bit_data: improved netCDF format supporting 64-bit integer data types.\n\nFiles can also be open and automatically closed with a do block.\n\nNCDataset(\"file.nc\") do ds\n    data = ds[\"temperature\"][:,:]\nend\n\nHere is an attribute example:\n\nusing DataStructures\nNCDataset(\"file.nc\", \"c\", attrib = OrderedDict(\"title\" => \"my first netCDF file\")) do ds\n   defVar(ds,\"temp\",[10.,20.,30.],(\"time\",))\nend;\n\nThe NetCDF dataset can also be a memory as a vector of bytes. A non-empty string a filename is still required, for example:\n\nusing NCDataset, HTTP\nresp = HTTP.get(\"https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/examples/ECMWF_ERA-40_subset.nc\")\nds = NCDataset(\"some_string\",\"r\",memory = resp.body)\ntotal_precipitation = ds[\"tp\"][:,:,:]\nclose(ds)\n\nDataset is an alias of NCDataset.\n\n\n\n\n\nmfds = NCDataset(fnames, mode = \"r\"; aggdim = nothing, deferopen = true,\n              isnewdim = false,\n              constvars = [])\n\nOpens a multi-file dataset in read-only \"r\" or append mode \"a\". fnames is a vector of file names.\n\nVariables are aggregated over the first unlimited dimension or over the dimension aggdim if specified. Variables without the dimensions aggdim are not aggregated. All variables containing the dimension aggdim are aggregated. The variable who do not contain the dimension aggdim are assumed constant.\n\nIf variables should be aggregated over a new dimension (not present in the NetCDF file), one should set isnewdim to true. All NetCDF files should have the same variables, attributes and groupes. Per default, all variables will have an additional dimension unless they are marked as constant using the constvars parameter.\n\nThe append mode is only implemented when deferopen is false. If deferopen is false, all files are opened at the same time. However the operating system might limit the number of open files. In Linux, the limit can be controled with the command ulimit.\n\nAll metadata (attributes and dimension length are assumed to be the same for all NetCDF files. Otherwise reading the attribute of a multi-file dataset would be ambiguous. An exception to this rule is the length of the dimension over which the data is aggregated. This aggregation dimension can varify from file to file.\n\nSetting the experimental flag _aggdimconstant to true means that the length of the aggregation dimension is constant. This speeds up the creating of a multi-file dataset as only the metadata of the first file has to be loaded.\n\nExamples:\n\nYou can use Glob.jl to make fnames from a file pattern, e.g.\n\nusing NCDatasets, Glob\nds = NCDataset(glob(\"ERA5_monthly3D_reanalysis_*.nc\"))\n\nAggregation over a new dimension:\n\nusing NCDatasets\nfor i = 1:3\n  NCDataset(\"foo$i.nc\",\"c\") do ds\n    defVar(ds,\"data\",[10., 11., 12., 13.], (\"lon\",))\n  end\nend\n\nds = NCDataset([\"foo$i.nc\" for i = 1:3],aggdim = \"sample\", isnewdim = true)\nsize(ds[\"data\"])\n# output\n# (4, 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"dataset/","page":"Datasets","title":"Datasets","text":"Useful functions that operate on datasets are:","category":"page"},{"location":"dataset/","page":"Datasets","title":"Datasets","text":"keys(ds::NCDataset)\nhaskey\ngetindex(ds::NCDataset,varname::AbstractString)\nvariable\ncfvariable\nsync\nclose\nNCDatasets.path\nncgen\nvarbyattrib\nwrite","category":"page"},{"location":"dataset/#Base.keys-Tuple{NCDataset}","page":"Datasets","title":"Base.keys","text":"keys(ds::NCDataset)\n\nReturn a list of all variables names in NCDataset ds.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"dataset/#Base.haskey","page":"Datasets","title":"Base.haskey","text":"haskey(ds::NCDataset,name)\nhaskey(d::Dimensions,name)\nhaskey(ds::Attributes,name)\n\nReturn true if the NCDataset ds (or dimension/attribute list) has a variable (dimension/attribute) with the name name.

Only the data corresponding to the index closest to target_coord is loaded.\na nearest match with tolerance: coord ≈ target_coord ± tolerance. As before, but if the difference between the closest value in coord and target_coord is larger (in absolute value) than tolerance, an empty array is returned.\na condition operating on scalar values. For example, a condition equal to 10 <= lon <= 20 loads all data with the longitude between 10 and 20 or abs(lat) > 60 loads all variables with a latitude north of 60° N and south of 60° S (assuming that the NetCDF has the 1D variables lon and lat for longitude and latitude).\n\nOnly the data which satisfies all conditions is loaded. All conditions must be chained with an && (logical and). They should not contain additional parenthesis or other logical operators such as || (logical or).\n\nTo convert the view into a regular array one can use collect, Array or regular indexing. As in julia, views of scalars are wrapped into a zero dimensional arrays which can be dereferenced by using []. Modifying a view will modify the underlying NetCDF file (if the file is opened as writable, otherwise an error is issued).\n\nAs for any view, one can use parentindices(vsubset) to get the indices matching a select query.\n\nExamples\n\nCreate a sample file with random data:\n\nusing NCDatasets, Dates\nfname = \"sample_file.nc\"\nlon = -180:180\nlat = -90:90\ntime = DateTime(2000,1,1):Day(1):DateTime(2000,1,3)\nSST = randn(length(lon),length(lat),length(time))\n\nds = NCDataset(fname,\"c\")\ndefVar(ds,\"lon\",lon,(\"lon\",));\ndefVar(ds,\"lat\",lat,(\"lat\",));\ndefVar(ds,\"time\",time,(\"time\",));\ndefVar(ds,\"SST\",SST,(\"lon\",\"lat\",\"time\"));\n\n\n# load by bounding box\nv = NCDatasets.@select(ds[\"SST\"],30 <= lon <= 60 && 40 <= lat <= 90)\n\n# substitute a local variable in condition using $\nlonr = (30,60) # longitude range\nlatr = (40,90) # latitude range\n\nv = NCDatasets.@select(ds[\"SST\"],$lonr[1] <= lon <= $lonr[2] && $latr[1] <= lat <= $latr[2])\n\n# You can also select based on `ClosedInterval`s from `IntervalSets.jl`.\n# Both 30..60 and 65 ± 25 construct `ClosedInterval`s, see their documentation for details.\n\nlon_interval = 30..60\nlat_interval = 65 ± 25\nv = NCDatasets.@select(ds[\"SST\"], lon ∈ $lon_interval && lat ∈ $lat_interval)\n\n# get the indices matching the select query\n(lon_indices,lat_indices,time_indices) = parentindices(v)\n\n# get longitude matchting the select query\nv_lon = v[\"lon\"]\n\n# find the nearest time instance\nv = NCDatasets.@select(ds[\"SST\"],time ≈ DateTime(2000,1,4))\n\n# find the nearest time instance but not earlier or later than 2 hours\n# an empty array is returned if no time instance is present\n\nv = NCDatasets.@select(ds[\"SST\"],time ≈ DateTime(2000,1,3,1) ± Hour(2))\n\nclose(ds)\n\nAny 1D variable with the same dimension name can be used in @select. For example, if we have a time series of temperature and salinity, the temperature values can also be selected based on salinity:\n\n# create a sample time series\nusing NCDatasets, Dates\nfname = \"sample_series.nc\"\ntime = DateTime(2000,1,1):Day(1):DateTime(2009,12,31)\nsalinity = randn(length(time)) .+ 35\ntemperature = randn(length(time))\n\nNCDataset(fname,\"c\") do ds\n    defVar(ds,\"time\",time,(\"time\",));\n    defVar(ds,\"salinity\",salinity,(\"time\",));\n    defVar(ds,\"temperature\",temperature,(\"time\",));\nend\n\nds = NCDataset(fname)\n\n# load all temperature data from January where the salinity is larger than 35.\nv = NCDatasets.@select(ds[\"temperature\"],Dates.month(time) == 1 && salinity >= 35)\n\n# this is equivalent to\nv2 = ds[\"temperature\"][findall(Dates.month.(time) .== 1 .&& salinity .>= 35)]\n\n@test v == v2\nclose(ds)\n\nnote: Note\nFor optimal performance, one should try to load contiguous data ranges, in particular when the data is loaded over HTTP/OPeNDAP.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"macro"},{"location":"experimental/#Experimental-functions","page":"Experimental features","title":"Experimental functions","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"experimental/","page":"Experimental features","title":"Experimental features","text":"NCDatasets.ancillaryvariables\nNCDatasets.filter","category":"page"},{"location":"experimental/#NCDatasets.ancillaryvariables","page":"Experimental features","title":"NCDatasets.ancillaryvariables","text":"ncvar = NCDatasets.ancillaryvariables(ncv::NCDatasets.CFVariable,modifier)\n\nReturn the first ancillary variables from the NetCDF variable ncv with the standard name modifier modifier.

As julia uses the Column-major ordering for arrays, the order of dimensions will appear reversed when the data is loaded in languages or programs using Row-major ordering such as C/C++, Python/NumPy or the tools ncdump/ncgen (NetCDF CDL). NumPy can also use Column-major ordering but Row-major order is the default. For the column-major interpretation of the dimensions (as in Julia), the CF Convention recommends the order  \"longitude\" (X), \"latitude\" (Y), \"height or depth\" (Z) and \"date or time\" (T) (if applicable). All other dimensions should, whenever possible, be placed to the right of the spatiotemporal dimensions.\n\nExample:\n\nIn this example, scale_factor and add_offset are applied when the data is saved.\n\njulia> using DataStructures\njulia> data = randn(3,5)\njulia> NCDataset(\"test_file.nc\",\"c\") do ds\n          defVar(ds,\"temp\",data,(\"lon\",\"lat\"), attrib = OrderedDict(\n             \"units\" => \"degree_Celsius\",\n             \"add_offset\" => -273.15,\n             \"scale_factor\" => 0.1,\n             \"long_name\" => \"Temperature\"\n          ))\n       end;\n\nnote: Note\nIf the attributes _FillValue, missing_value, add_offset, scale_factor, units and calendar are used, they should be defined when calling defVar by using the parameter attrib as shown in the example above.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"variables/#Storage-parameter-of-a-variable","page":"Variables","title":"Storage parameter of a variable","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"variables/","page":"Variables","title":"Variables","text":"chunking\ndeflate\nchecksum","category":"page"},{"location":"variables/#NCDatasets.chunking","page":"Variables","title":"NCDatasets.chunking","text":"storage,chunksizes = chunking(v::Variable)\n\nReturn the storage type (:contiguous or :chunked) and the chunk sizes of the varable v.\n\n\n\n\n\nstorage,chunksizes = chunking(v::MFVariable)\n\nReturn the storage type (:contiguous or :chunked) and the chunk sizes of the varable v corresponding to the first NetCDF file.
